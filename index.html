        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Jordan Norman. I currently studying Political Science as an undergraduate at UC Riverside to get my Bachelorâ€™s degree. Hopefully, I want it to develop as Political Science: Law and Society. I started studying here in the Fall of 2022. I am a high school graduate of Eleanor Roosevelt high school in Eastvale, California. After I graduate from college I want to pursue a more activist route or somehow help/improve the black community in any way I can.<br><br>

          My personality type is INTJ which stands for Introvert, Intuitive, Turbulant, and Judging a person. Iâ€™m trying to break out of my shell due to my first nature of being an introvert. My hobbies are shopping, listening to music like RnB and Kpop, also I like hanging out with my friends. My zodiac sign is a leo because I was born August 3rd, 2004. What makes me happy is taking mental breaks, watching my comfort TV shows, and eating food. My favorite show is friends because Iâ€™ve been watching it since freshman year of high school and just been watching over every now and then.<br><br>

          For my Goals, my #1 is working on my mental health because Iâ€™ve been struggling with it since High school and I canâ€™t do what I would want to do if not in the right mental head space so I think mental health is essential for it. My next goal is to find a balance in my life for school and for myself and I need that especially when starting college because I donâ€™t want to feel burnt out at the beginning of my college years. I feel like I need to start eating healthier because I donâ€™t feel great when I eat greasy unhealthy foods. I really want to get my bachelor's degree in Political Science: Law and Society so I can figure out what I want to do to be happy and have a purpose. I want to earn Aâ€™s and Bâ€™s for my first quarter so I can keep that mindset for the future classes I would like to take later on. This university has had a big impact on my life since I just started. I got better as it is going right now because I was struggling mentally going here because of going through this change. I want to experience more on-campus tho because I have just been going to class and mostly being open to residential life instead of campus life.
          The only thing I have done was go to the asp building to look into there and I have gone to the annual block party they plan once a year.Hopefully next year Iâ€™ll be more involved and take leadership roles at this university by then. Iâ€™ve moved a lot throughout my life but Iâ€™ve grown up in Eastvale. I love this place because I have made my best friends that I talk to this day there and most of my family is over or from around there. Most of the time it was black culture and the house I wanted to bring that out in high school which is why I liked helping out in Black Student Union.
